# fieldDataProcessing

This repository facilitates field data processing. 
## Kobo
Kobo Collect is a free survey platform that produces xml files for each survey response.
https://www.kobotoolbox.org/
It is possible to upload Kobo forms to the web and then download a single csv or excel file of the survey responses. 
However, if you are without internet or cell service and unable to upload, it is best to backup your data. Phones and tablets can be lost. 
You can copy the forms to your computer and run the KoboCollect R script to compile all of the xml files (instances) into a single database.
